## Review
The README.md looks good, other than a few minor formating errors that are easy to fix

[notebook_dev_basics_markdown.ipynb](.notebook_dev_basics_markdown.ipynb) looks good. It talks about what Markdown is, and talks about the basics

[notebook_dev_basics_latex_math.ipynb](./notebook_dev_basics_latex_math.ipynb) is essentially just a cheat sheet for the most common LaTeX symbols. It doesn't talk about the basics of LaTeX (lets just use latex from now on). It also doesn't talk about markdown compatability, like inline latex ($\frac{1}{2}$)
