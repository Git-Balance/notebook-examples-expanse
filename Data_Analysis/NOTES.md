## Review
In [data_analysis_pandas.ipynb](./data_analysis_pandas.ipynb#Selecting-rows)], there may be a spelling error
```python
# Return a DataFrame selecting row 2-6 (iloc and single brackets)
df.iloc[2:5]
```
Doesn't this only get rows 2-4 of the DataFrame?

Overall, this notebook looks great. The only real problem is the directory is named "Data_Analysis" instead of something along the lines of "Pandas_Intro." This is basically just an overview of Pandas. The only problem with renaming this directory is that it might be *too* in depth

Update on the directory naming update. Long story short, the Pandas notebook
